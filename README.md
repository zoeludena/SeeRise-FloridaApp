# SeeRise: Visualizing Emulated Sea Level Rise on Florida

[Application](https://seerise-floridaapp.streamlit.app/)

This application predicts the sea level rise in the year 2100 under the assumption of SSP 245's values in the present year (2025). The only variable you are controlling is cumulative carbon dioxide. Your starting point is how many gigatons of carbon dioxide there is in 2025 (3340 giga tons).

You can select different emulators based off of the ClimateBench 🌎. These emulators use your input of cumulative carbon dioxide and the SSP 245's values for other greenhouse gases in 2025 to predict the temperature in 2100 🌡️. From there we predicted the sea level rise using linear regression.
